 * What gets deleted vs. kept, precisely:

 *   KEPT    — the documentation_photos row (GPS, timestamp, accuracy, which
 *             risk events it triggered), every work_report, risk_event,
 *             treatment_record, customer review, and audit_log entry.
 *             Nothing else is touched.
 *
 * This is a storage-cost measure, not a data-retention-shortening measure —
 * the full history of what happened on a job stays queryable forever, only
 * the JPEG bytes are reclaimed.
